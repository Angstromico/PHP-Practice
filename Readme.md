# PHP Practice Repository

## Introduction

This repository is dedicated to practicing PHP. I'm returning to the language after some time and using this space to shake off the rust and refresh my skills.

## Goals

- Re-familiarize with PHP syntax and core functions.
- Experiment with modern PHP features.
- Build small scripts and utilities.
